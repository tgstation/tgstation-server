      Author: Cyberboss
      PullRequest: 1461
    - Descriptions:
      - Added `General:DeploymentDirectoryCopyTasksPerCore` to allow operators to manually adjust the rate at which asynchronous file copies are performed on instances. Too few can significantly increase deployment times, too many can make TGS unresponsive and slowdown other I/O operations on the machine. Leaving this unset disables the throttle entirely. **Note that this is the default for upgraded TGS installations. Server operators should highly consider setting the throttle.** The default value for new installations is `100`.

The formatters `${Major}`, `${Minor}`, and `${Patch}` are available for the current TGS API version. If set to "local" the previous behavior of loading the bundled control panel will be used. **Upgrading installations will have this set to `null` by default and thus be non-functional. Consider setting it to the current default upstream: `https://tgstation.github.io/tgstation-server-webpanel/api/${Major}.${Minor}.${Patch}`.**'

      PullRequest: 1213
  - Version: 2.2.0
    Changes:

    - Descriptions:
      - Added the `Swarm` configuration section for configuring the swarm system.
      - '`Swarm:PrivateKey` should be a secure string set identically on all swarmed servers. Setting this enables the swarm system. If this is to happen, ensure all swarm servers are set to connect to the same database.'
      - '`Swarm:ControllerAddress` should be set on all swarmed servers that are **not** the controller server and should be an address the controller server may be reached at.'
      - '`Swarm:Address` should be set on all swarmed servers. Should be an address the server can be reached at by other servers in the swarm.'
      - '`Swarm:Identifier` should be set uniquely on all swarmed servers. Used to identify the current server. This is also used to select which instances exist on the current machine and should not be changed post-setup.'

      - '`Security:TokenSigningKeyByteCount` allows adjusting the amount of bytes used to generate token signing keys. Default is `256`.'
      - '`Security:CustomTokenSigningKeyBase64` allows setting a persistent token signing key as a base64 string. This will allow tokens to persist past server reboots. Having it set to the default of `null` will keep the current behavior of generating a new key every server launch.'
      - Mapping Discord channel 0 will now associate with all other unmapped channels accessible to the bot.
      - The Discord bot will appear to be typing when responding to a command.

      - Swarm server nodes now inherit the token signing key of the controller, meaning that an authentication token generated on one server will work for all servers in the swarm. This behavior occurs for all swarm nodes regardless of `Security` configuration settings.
      - The swarm protocol is now versioned separately from the TGS core version. This allows for slightly differing servers to group together in a swarm. Updates will still synchronize all servers to the same version. **It is still recommended that all servers in the swarm run the same TGS version.**

      - TGS now supports running DreamMaker coded games with OpenDream, the open source reimplementation of BYOND. Note that TGS requires the dotnet SDK version supported by the OpenDream version you'd like to use alongside it's normal ASP.NET Core runtime to build it.
      - The repository cloning job now reports checkout progress.
      - Fixed rare DreamDaemon startup failure that may occur due to a lingering socket.
      - Event scripts containing "Byond" in their names have been updated to use "Engine" instead. Old names will continue function.
      - Socket bind tests will now retry for up to 5s before failing with an AddressInUse exception.
      - Added a workaround for a potential hang while recording process output.

      - The `.deb` package now runs tgstation-server as the user `tgstation-server`. This user has minimal permissions. More may be granted manually by system administrators. **IF YOU OPT TO UPDATE VIA APT, YOU MAY HAVE THIS USER AUTOMATICALLY SET AS THE SERVICE RUNNER, EVEN IF IT DOES NOT EXIST!** To fix this, edit `/etc/lib/systemd/system/tgstation-server.service` and remove the `User=tgstation-server` line.

      - TGS now ships with a Debian (Ubuntu compatible) package and provides apt repository to download it from. This is available at the /tg/station apt repository https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-ppa. See `README.md` for details.
      - Added SystemD `notify-reload` support. See `build/tgstation-server.service` for a unit example. Note, when running under SystemD, the majority of standard output messages will be suppressed unless `FileLogging:Disable` is set to `true` in order not to duplicate log output.

    - Descriptions:
      - tgstation-server no longer holds a .NET Framework 4.7.2 dependency for running the Windows service.
      - tgstation-server now ships an `.exe` installer for Windows. It automatically downloads and installs the required .NET dependency if needed. You can either download it from GitHub Releases or install it via `winget install Tgstation.Server`. Once initially installed, it can be used to perform seamless updates same as using the HTTP API would.
      - Fixed the internal configuration setting `General:DesignTime` being exposed in `appsettings.Prodution.yml`s the setup wizard generates.
      - The setup wizard now has default recommendations for the majority of its options that can be quickly navigated through.
      - The configuration directory (where the `appsettings.yml` files are loaded from) can now be specified with the command line argument `--appsettings-base-path=XXX`. Remember that this is meant to be passed through either the console or service host watchdog.
      - When specifying a relative path to an SQLite database, the base directory will now be the configuration directory.
      - The TGS console window title will now reflect the version being run or if you're running the setup wizard.
      - Fixed Windows service creating a `BYOND` directory in the installation folder.

      - If a deployment has the DMAPI available, the code tree change-out will be delayed until `world.TgsReboot()` is called. This prevents the working directory from changing unexpectedly around an active server.

    Changes:
    - Descriptions:
      - Added the `GitHub` OAuth provider. Create OAuth apps at https://github.com/settings/developers
      - Added the `Discord` OAuth provider. Create OAuth apps at https://discord.com/developers/applications
      - Added the `TGForums` OAuth provider. Does NOT use `ClientId` config. See documentation at https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=9922&p=582075
      - 'Added the `Keycloak` OAuth provider. Uses `ServerUrl` config. A somewhat simple guide to setting this up can be found here: https://plugins.miniorange.com/keycloak-single-sign-on-wordpress-sso-oauth-openid-connect (Note, the user grouping bits may be skipped).'
      - Added missing v4.5.X downgrade migration.
      - Added informative logging when users are created/updated.
      - ':cl:'
      - ':cl: HTTP API'
      - Header names are now case-sensitive.
      - Fixed being unable to clear repository access strings.
      - Fixed GitHub API errors not being returned if a server update failed.
      - GET `/` no longer requires authentication.
      - The `ServerInformation` model now contains the `oAuthProviderInfos` field. This is a map of OAuth provider names to their `clientId`s and `redirectUri`s (OAuthProviderInfo model).
      - Added a new field to the `User` model, `oAuthConnections`. This is a list of `OAuthConnection` models that indicate `externalUserId`s the user may use to authentication along with the `provider` ID of the OAuth provider. A user may have many `OAuthConnection`s with the same `provider` but the same `provider`/`externalUserId` pair can not be added to multiple users.
      - Added Administration right 64 which allows users to edit their own `oAuthConnections`. This is a subset of right 1.
      - 'Added OAuth authentication. POST `/` with headers `Authorization: OAuth <Authorization response code from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2>` and `OAuthProvider: <Provider Name>` to receive a bearer token with extended duration.'
      - Added error code 95 for when one attempts to create `OAuthConnection`s on the `Admin` account as this is not allowed.
      - Added error code 96 for when a login attempt is made with a disabled OAuth provider.
      - Users may now be created with no passwords and system identifiers if they have an OAuthConnection set. A user cannot have it's password removed after having one set later.

      PullRequest: 1164
    - Descriptions:
      - Added the swarm system. This allows a group of TGS servers to use the same database while maintaining separated instances. As a result, credentials that work on one server will work on any in the swarm. The swarm system only works if all servers are running the same TGS version. If an update is requested for one server in the swarm, all servers will be updated.
      - '**If a server has existing instances it should not join or leave a server swarm or it will lose access to these instances**. Please see the migration guide in the documentation.'

      - The default config value for `General:RestartTimeout` has been changed from 5s to 60s. **It is recommended server operators make this change as well since if it is hit, running DreamDaemon processes may become orphaned during reboot/update operations and must be killed manually before being launched again with TGS**.

  - Version: 10.13.0
    Changes:
    - Descriptions:
      - Added `oidcProviderInfos` to server information model. These list a `friendlyName`, user definable `themeColour`, and user definable `themeIconUrl` for indicating how to display OIDC providers. The `schemeKey` property is how authentication is performed. Send users to `/oidc/{schemeKey}/signin` to start the OIDC flow. Users will be returned to a configured endpoint (`/app` by default) with the query parameter `state` set to `oidc.{schemeKey}` and either a `code` indicating a TGS bearer token to use or a user readable `error`.
      - Added `oidcConnections` to users, similar to `oAuthConnections` with the only difference being that the `provider` is replaced with a `schemeKey` string. Modifiable with the same right.

  - Version: 8.0.0
    Changes:
    - Descriptions:
      - File transfers have been revamped. The `RawData` model has been replaced with the `FileTicketResult` model. This contains one string field, `fileTicket`. Transfers are now done as standard `application/octet-stream` GET/PUT requests to the new `/Transfer` endpoint. Requests should be made to `/Transfer?ticket=<fileTicket>` after receiving a `FileTicketResult`. Returns HTTP 200/204 on successful transfers, or standard 409/410 `ErrorMessage`s otherwise. Because of this change, the size limit for file transfers has been increased to 2GB.
      - Added ErrorCode 97 for when a job fails due to waiting on an expired upload request.
      - POST `/Configuration` no longer updates `lastReadHash` field of the returned `ConfigurationFile` model.

    - Descriptions:
      - Renamed the TestMergeParameters model field `pullRequestRevision` to `targetCommitSha`.
      - Renamed Repository model field `gitHubOwner` to `remoteRepositoryOwner`.
      - Renamed Repository model field `gitHubName` to `remoteRepositoryName`.
      - Added field `repositoryOrigin` to CompileJob model, set to the repository's origin URL at the time of deployment. Will be `null` for jobs run on older TGS versions.
      - Added Repository model field `remoteGitProvider` which is a numeric enum of supported remote git providers such as `GitHub`, `GitLab`, or `Unknown`.

      PullRequest: 1163
    - Descriptions:
      - Added the PermissionSet model. The User model's `instanceManagerRights` and `administrationRights` fields have been migrated here. They have their own `id`s.
      - Added the UserGroup model. They have an `id`, `name`, list of `users` (shallow), and `permissionSet`.
      - The User model can either have a dedicated `permissionSet` or belong to a `group`.
      - UserGroups are managed via the `/UserGroup` endpoint. PUT creates a group. POST can be used to change a groups `name` and `permissionSet`. GET `/{id}` gets a specific group. GET `/List` lists all groups (using the new pagination system). DELETE `/{id}` deletes an empty group.
      - UserGroup membership is handled on a user-by-user basis with POST `/User`.
      - Everything relating to InstanceUsers has been renamed to InstancePermissionSets. They are now associated with PermissionSets as opposed to Users via their `permissionSetId`. Rights enums have also been renamed, but maintain their functionality.
      - Added ErrorCode 98 when trying to give a user both a UserGroup and PermissionSet.
      - Added ErrorCode 99 when trying to delete a non-empty UserGroup.
      - Previously deprecated ErrorCode 46 is now used when trying to change UserGroup membership with the `/UserGroup` route.
      - Previously deprecated ErrorCode 54 is now used  when trying to remove all OAuthConnections from a password-less user.

      PullRequest: 1164
    - Descriptions:
      - Endpoints that previously returned top-level array responses are now paginated. Each endpoint now takes optional `page` number (defaulting to 1) and `pageSize` (currently defaulting to 10, but subject to change in the future) query parameters. The returned model is wrapped in a generic Paginated model. Along with the `content` array, it contains the request `pageSize` and `totalPages` for the request.
      - Previously deprecated ErrorCode 40 is now used when requesting too large a `pageSize`.
      - Previously deprecated ErrorCode 41 is now used when requesting `page` or `pageSize`s <= 0.
      - '`windowsHost` moved from Administration to ServerInformation model.'
      - GET `/Administration` now requires the `ChangeVersion` Administration right.

  - Version: 7.1.0
    Changes:
    - Descriptions:
      - Added a new builtin user "TGS". This user cannot be accessed via the API and is used by the server to create startup/reattach and auto update jobs as well as create the Admin user.
      - Fixed an issue where ErrorCode 78 could occur for non-socket address in use related errors.
      - Attempting to access an offline instance now results in a 409 response with the new ErrorCode 90 as opposed to 403. 403 Will still be returned if the user isn't authorized to access that instance.
      - Added ErrorCode 91 for when chat bots fail to connect.
      - Fixed issues where an instance could be reported as offline when it was actually online and vice-versa.
      - Chat provider (re)connection is now done as a job, there is no way to retrieve this job upon creation through the API currently. Though it provides a roundabout way to see why it is failing.
      - Fixed a rare 500 error on GET /DreamDaemon as the server was crashing.

      PullRequest: 1069
    - Descriptions:
      - Added the DreamMaker field `requireDMApiValidation`, defaulting to `true`. If `false` deployments that time out on DMAPI validation will still be available for use. This comes with the restriction that all DMAPI functionality, heartbeats, and graceful restarts (including those required by BYOND version switches) will be unavailable for the deployment. Deploying new code with the same BYOND version will still work seamlessly.
      - Added DreamMaker permission 128 for enabling/disabling the DMAPI requirement for deployments.
      - Fixed DreamMaker permission 64 not granting access to POST /DreamMaker.
      - Fixed failed Jobs always returning `null` for their `errorCode`.
