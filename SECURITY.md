## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should ideally be reported by directly messaging one of the TGS maintainers on Discord. Maintainers can be found in the [#coderbus](https://discord.gg/Vh8TJp9) guild in the [#hosting-questions](https://discord.com/channels/484170914754330625/653425022966169620) channel. Please be sure to provide reproduction steps.

Here is a list of their discord IDs.
